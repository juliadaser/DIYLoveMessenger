## About 
Our DIY Love Messengers are the perfect gift for your friends/ partners, especially long-distance ones! When the button of one love messenger is pressed, both of them will light up! All files, code and 3D models can be found in this repository.

We are using the ESP32 microcontrollers for this tutorial. We also created a previous tutorial on [How to send data between many ESP32s from anywhere in the world] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx5cEIbBvZY&ab_channel=WormiCollective).
